## Inheritance

If you want the fns in parent contract to be customised in the child contract,
then declare that function as "virtual"
And in the child contract declare copy those function and declare it as "override"

A function can have both virtual and override declaration if it has to be 
inherited further down for customising

## Multiple Inheritance

Order of Inheritance will be most base like to derived

eg:

    x
  / |
 y  |
  \ |
    Z
    order of inheritance - x, y, z
   1 - (z inherits from both x and y, y inherits from x, but x inherits from ntg)
   2 - (y inherits from x only but z inherits from both x and y)

    x
  /   \
 y     A
 |     |
 |     B
  \   /
    z

    order of inheritance - x, y, A, B, z (y and A can be interchanged)

contract Z is X, Y { // order is important or else wont compile - most base like to derived
    function foo() public pure override(X, Y) returns(string memory) { // since the same fn is inherited from multiple ctrt
        return "Z";
    }

    function bar() public pure override(Y, X) returns(string memory) { // order don't matter
        return "Z";
    }
}

## Calling parent constructor inside (multiple)inherited contract

// order of execution - The order in which the constructor is called inside the function doesn't matter
// S
// T
// U

1. contract U is S("s"), T("t") {  // If we know the constructor input value - static input
    
}

2. contract V is S, T { 
    constructor(string memory _text, string memory _name) S(_text) T(_name) {// Dynamically passing input values

    }
}

3. contract W is S("s"), T {
    constructor(string memory _name) T(_name) { // combination of static and dynamic

    }
}

The order of initializition of the parent constructor is determined by the order of contracts inherited

## Calling parent functions
- directly - directly calls and executes the defined parent contract
- super - calls all the parent contract(multiple inheritance) and executed all of their inherited functions
